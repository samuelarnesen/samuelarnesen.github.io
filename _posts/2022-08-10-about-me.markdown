Hi! I'm an NYC-based AI influencer. For three years, I was a Software Engineer at Amazon, where I worked on improving the performance and extensibility of the core infrastructure in the advertising division. Before that, I was a computer science major at Princeton University, where my thesis was on fine-tuning language models by applying reinforcement learning to text-based games. 

I also competed in debate, where I was the runner-up at the World Universities Debating Championship, top individual debater at the collegiate North American Debating Championship, and two-time high school national champion. I maade history when I developed a novel, modern interpretation of the Bill of Rights live during a [debate round](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtTw_G7L6I8), revolutionizing the constitutional law for the years to come.

My interests include trivia, board games, and playing basketball (poorly). I'm originally from Chicago and Bethesda (MD), but I currently live in New York City. Follow me for the ten tips you're missing to SUPERCHARGE your ChatGPT use!
