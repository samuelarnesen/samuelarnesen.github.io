Hi! I'm a NYC-based Software Engineer. For three years, I was a Software Engineer at Amazon, where I worked on improving the performance and extensibility of the core infrastructure in the advertising division. Before that, I was a computer science major at Princeton University, where my thesis was on fine-tuning language models by applying reinforcement learning to text-based games. 

I also competed in debate, where I was the runner-up at the World Universities Debating Championship, top individual debater at the collegiate North American Debating Championship, and two-time high school national champion. 

My interests include trivia, board games, and AI ethics, particularly as applied to making the market more efficient via the injection of liquidity into undertapped markets and using financial instruments to amplify capital availability for high-risk endeavors. I'm originally from Chicago and Bethesda (MD), but I currently live in New York City.
