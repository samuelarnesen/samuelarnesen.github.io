I am a Research Engineer in the Alignment Research Group at NYU's Center for Data Science. Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Amazon, where I worked on improving the performance and extensibility of the core infrastructure in the advertising division. Before that, I was a computer science major at Princeton University, where my thesis was on fine-tuning language models by applying reinforcement learning to text-based games.

<br/>
I also competed in debate, where I was the runner-up at the World Universities Debating Championship, top individual debater at the collegiate North American Debating Championship, and two-time high school national champion.

Outside of work, I spend a lot of time making overly elaborate trivia questions, which you should check out <a href="trivia.html">here.</a>
